# Ink
Notebook application created first time for public release.

This is the very first app created on my own during the summer right after my very first Android app, Chatterbox.
Started on July 1st, 2015.

Everyone has their own preference of colors. A color has no shape, has no scent; we mostly observe it subconsciously. But colors are the first element of anything we observe. In fact, they shape our experience with objects. In this app, I hope to allow you to freely express yourself and utilize your time with colored notes. 

Different colors affect people differently and depending how what color you see, your mentality changes. I incorporated this idea with notes. People take notes all the time, whether it be a list of work or jotting down your thoughts. Assigning a specific color to your notes will change your mindset as you read or write them. For example, green is the color of nature, which relaxes the user. On the contrary, orange is the color of imagination and progress, which motivates the user. But this is only a generalized fact and everyone feels different emotions depending on the color they see. And incorporating both emotion and brainpower creates maximum productivity.

Ink lets you choose the "color" of the note. Doing so will color the entire note in that "color" and also make the title header of the note that "color" when clicked on. By choosing the color of the note, you also decide the emotion which you feel with the note. If you want, you can also choose a photo to be associated with the note instead of the color.

Time is precious, and this app helps you to not only maximize productivity, but also understand that productivity does not have to be so bland and emotionless.
