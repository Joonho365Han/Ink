# Ink
Notebook application created first time for public release.

This is the very first app created on my own during the summer right after my very first Android app, Chatterbox.
Started on July 1st, 2015.

Everyone has their own preference of colors. 

A color has no shape, has no scent; we mostly observe it subconsciously. But colors are the first element of anything we observe. In fact, they shape our experience with objects. I hope Ink allows you to freely express yourself and utilize your time with colored notes.

Different colors affect people differently and depending how what color you see, your mentality changes. Ink lets you choose the "color" of the note. Doing so will color the entire note in that "color" and also make the title header of the note that "color" when clicked on. By choosing the color of the note, you also decide the emotion which you feel with the note. If you want, you can also choose a photo to be associated with the note instead of the color.

Time is precious, and this app helps you to not only maximize productivity, but also understand that productivity does not have to be so bland and emotionless.
